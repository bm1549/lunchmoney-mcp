A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server implementation for [LunchMoney](https://lunchmoney.app/), providing programmatic access to personal finance management through LunchMoney's API. Also available as an MCP Bundle (.mcpb) for easy installation in Claude Desktop.

> **Heads up — v2.0.0 is a breaking release.** This server now targets LunchMoney's v2 API (`https://api.lunchmoney.dev/v2`, currently in alpha). It is not backwards-compatible with v1.x of this server: tool names, fields, and endpoint shapes have changed (for example, `assets` is now `manual_accounts`, `tags` arrays are now `tag_ids`, transaction `asset_id` is now `manual_account_id`, the `debit_as_negative` toggle is gone, and the budget summary moved to a new `/summary` endpoint). See [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md) for the full list. If you depend on v1.x, pin `@akutishevsky/lunchmoney-mcp@^1.4.3`.

</details>

<a id="manual-mcp-configuration"></a>

<details>
<summary><strong>Manual MCP Configuration</strong></summary>

To use this MCP server with any MCP-compatible client (such as Claude Desktop), you need to add it to the client's configuration.

##### Configuration

The server can be configured in your MCP client's configuration file. The exact location and format may vary by client, but typically follows this pattern:

```json
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "lunchmoney": {
            "command": "npx",
            "args": ["@akutishevsky/lunchmoney-mcp"],
            "env": {
                "LUNCHMONEY_API_TOKEN": "your-api-token-here",
                "LUNCHMONEY_DEBUG": "true"
            }
        }
    }
}
```

> **Note:** `LUNCHMONEY_DEBUG` is optional. Set it to `"true"` to enable debug logging of API requests and responses to stderr. Useful for troubleshooting.

> **Note:** `LUNCHMONEY_ATTACHMENTS_DIR` is optional. `attach_file_to_transaction` is the only tool that reads from your filesystem, and it always verifies that a file really is a JPEG, PNG, HEIC, HEIF, or PDF before uploading it. Set this variable to a directory (say, a `~/Receipts` folder) to additionally restrict it to files inside that directory — `..` and symlinks that point outside are rejected. Leave it unset and any path the server can read is fair game, which is usually fine for a local stdio server but **not** for [remote deployments](#remote-deployments).

Replace `"your-api-token-here"` with your actual LunchMoney API token from [LunchMoney Developer Settings](https://my.lunchmoney.app/developers).

##### Common MCP Client Configuration Locations

Different MCP clients store their configuration in different locations:

- **Claude Desktop**:
    - macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
    - Windows: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`
    - Linux: `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

- **Other MCP Clients**: Check your client's documentation for the configuration file location.

##### Setup Steps

1. Locate your MCP client's configuration file (create it if it doesn't exist).
2. Add the LunchMoney server configuration to the `mcpServers` section.
3. Save the file and restart your MCP client.
4. The LunchMoney tools should now be available in your client.

##### Requirements

- Node.js 16+ installed on your system
- `npx` available in your system PATH
- Valid LunchMoney API token with appropriate permissions

</details>

### Standalone Server

```bash
# Run with npx
LUNCHMONEY_API_TOKEN="your-api-token" npx @akutishevsky/lunchmoney-mcp
```

## Remote Deployments

The bundled stdio binary covers desktop MCP clients, but Claude on mobile and the [custom connectors](https://support.anthropic.com/en/articles/11503834-using-custom-connectors-with-claude) feature in [claude.ai](https://claude.ai) only speak HTTP. There are two ways to expose this server remotely.

### Turnkey: Cloudflare Workers

[lunchmoney-mcp-cloudflare](https://github.com/bm1549/lunchmoney-mcp-cloudflare) wraps this package as a Cloudflare Worker with Google sign-in and an email allowlist in front of the MCP endpoint. The whole stack fits inside Cloudflare's and Google Cloud's free tiers, and a `setup.sh` wizard handles KV creation, OAuth client setup, secrets, and deploy in one walkthrough. Each authenticated user runs in their own Durable Object, so the [config](#embedding-as-a-library) stays per-user.

### Self-hosted: HTTP transport on your own host

For a single-user deployment, wire `createServer()` into [`StreamableHTTPServerTransport`](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk#streamable-http-transport) and serve it from any Node HTTP framework. Example with Express:

```ts
import express from "express";
import { createServer } from "@akutishevsky/lunchmoney-mcp/server";
import { initializeConfig } from "@akutishevsky/lunchmoney-mcp/config";
import { StreamableHTTPServerTransport } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/streamableHttp.js";

initializeConfig(process.env.LUNCHMONEY_API_TOKEN!);
const server = createServer("1.0.0");

const transport = new StreamableHTTPServerTransport({
    sessionIdGenerator: () => crypto.randomUUID(),
});
await server.connect(transport);

const app = express();
app.use(express.json());
app.all("/mcp", (req, res) => transport.handleRequest(req, res, req.body));
app.listen(3000);
```

Swap Express for Hono (via `@hono/node-server`) or Fastify if you prefer — the transport only needs Node's `IncomingMessage` and `ServerResponse`. Add your own auth in front of `/mcp` — the package ships no transport-level auth.

> **Set `LUNCHMONEY_ATTACHMENTS_DIR` on any remote deployment.** `attach_file_to_transaction` reads a path supplied by the caller off the host's filesystem. On a desktop stdio server the caller and the file owner are the same person, so that is unremarkable. Once the server is reachable over HTTP they are different principals, and an unconfined read is a way for a remote caller — or a prompt-injected model — to pull files off your host. Point the variable at a dedicated directory and keep nothing else in it. The content-type check (only real JPEG/PNG/HEIC/HEIF/PDF files upload) applies either way, but it is a backstop, not a substitute.

> **Multi-tenant warning.** This pattern serves one user from one process with one shared API token, since the example above calls `initializeConfig`. To serve multiple users from a single Node process, switch to [`runWithConfig`](#embedding-as-a-library) and scope each request's token to its own async context, fork the process per user, or use the Cloudflare option above (each user gets their own isolate).

### Building

```bash
# Build the MCP server
npm run build

# Build MCPB package for distribution
npm run build:mcpb
```

### Adding New Tools

1. Create a new file in `src/tools/`
2. Implement tool handlers using the MCP SDK
3. Register tools in `src/index.ts`
4. Add types to `src/types.ts` if needed

### Embedding as a library

The package exposes subpath entry points so it can be embedded in a custom transport (for example, a Cloudflare Worker that serves the MCP protocol over HTTP) rather than only the bundled stdio binary:

```ts
import { createServer } from "@akutishevsky/lunchmoney-mcp/server";
import {
    initializeConfig,
    runWithConfig,
} from "@akutishevsky/lunchmoney-mcp/config";

// Single-tenant (stdio, one-user CLI): set the token once at startup.
initializeConfig(process.env.LUNCHMONEY_API_TOKEN!);
const server = createServer("1.0.0");
// connect `server` to whatever transport you need

// Multi-tenant (a stateless Worker or process serving many users from one
// runtime): scope the token to each request's async context instead.
await runWithConfig(perUserToken, async () => {
    // handle this user's request; tool calls inside here see `perUserToken`
});
```

Before any tool is invoked, config must be established — `initializeConfig` for the single-tenant case, or a `runWithConfig` call wrapping the request for the multi-tenant case — or the first tool call throws `"Configuration not initialized. Call initializeConfig() or runWithConfig() first."`.

> **Choosing between them.** `initializeConfig` sets a process-wide token. That's fine on a per-isolate runtime — each user already gets their own isolate — or in a genuinely single-tenant deployment (stdio, one-user CLI). It is **not** safe on shared-process multi-tenant Node hosts (e.g. one Express or Hono process serving multiple users): concurrent `initializeConfig` calls would race and leak tokens between requests. `runWithConfig` scopes the token to the async context of the callback you pass it, so concurrent requests in the same process can't see each other's tokens — multi-tenant hosts must use it instead of `initializeConfig`.
